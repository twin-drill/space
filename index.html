        <h6 style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0; margin-left: 4px"><em>George Perec</em></h6>
        <hr>
        <p>Perec's <em>Species of Spaces</em> disambiguates a generally ambiguous understanding of "space".</p>
        <p>As Perec says,</p>
        <span class="quote">"The subject of this book is not the void exactly, but rather what there is round about or inside it."</span>
        <p>His text is abstract and explores various 'spaces', beginning from the area of the page and expanding into the places we live our lives.</p>
        <p>A novel analogy is one from David Coward:</p>
        <span class="quote">"...his writing here is like those representations of three-dimensional figures on a computer screen, slowly turning to present unexpected sides &#8212; a simple and yet still surprising trick."</span>
        <p><em>Species of Spaces</em>, much like a computer graphic, is meant to be applied within the context of our lives and not interpreted as an isolated statement.</p>
        <p>A possible reading of <em>Species of Spaces</em> views Perec's deconstruction of spaces as an attempt to reassess our familiarity and dismissal of the things that surround us.
            Perec often reserves entire segments of his essay to list actions one could create a room for in a vast 'apartment', among other large 'lists.'</p>

        <h6 style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0; margin-left: 4px"><em>and those we do not</em></h6>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Perec's thoughts on the various spaces around him come directly from his own memories and experiences. He explores
             memories as tools to paint a picture of something completely new.
        </p>
        <span class="quote">"We can imagine well enough what a gustatorium might be, or an auditory, but one might wonder what a seeery might look like, or a smellery or a feelery."</span>
        <p>
            To state something obvious: Perec's imagination is inextricably linked to his memories. However, when examining this idea further
             we can extrapolate that the space Perec imagines for a "smellery" would be very different to any of ours. As an elementary axiom: the technologies of today are vastly different
            to those Perec experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another interesting idea is one that examines the words we use when imagining such spaces. A tasting room has likely not been referred to as a "gustatorium"
            by very many people lately, but the two phrases make us imagine slightly different things. An important note is the context of a word &#8212; you would probably
            not think of the same place when thinking of a kitchen and a cafeteria. An argument can be made that the context of the word itself can be what defines a space,
            that people imagine more similar spaces when given the same general definition with that term. It's important to recognize that language is trying to communicate
            various details from a person to another, but it is interpreted by the person that hears it. An example might be the same word in two languages: a person cannot understand
            the word without knowing what it means. If you do know another language, it's simple to see &#8212; a word in one language brings up a completely different idea than the same word
            in another language.
        </p>
        <p>
            All this to say, succinctly: the interpretation of any medium relies heavily on the perspective of the observer (bar death and taxes, to some degree).

            We have established that much of what is communicated to us cannot be interpreted without our personal contexts, but what does this truly mean?
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider this discussion classroom. We know it as room 7111, the room in which we have discussion for English 140 twice a week. If you've had another class
            in this room before, it might mean even more to you. But what does the physical space that this room occupies mean if we examine it before the building was built?
            This classroom didn't mean anything to people before the walls that define it were erected. But even with these walls, it meant nothing to <em>us</em> until we had
            this class in it. And one day, when these walls are inevitably torn down, the space will not mean anything to those who haven't experienced it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here we discover that we cannot examine space without the context of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            But if we go back to the previous example, the place where the room once was will mean something to you, even though it no longer exists. Your memories and experiences in that room preserve an idea of that space in
            your mind. The space, so to speak, lies in a superposition of existence, the observer's context leading to its collapse. The space exists and does not exist simultaneously, depending on who is interpreting it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we have found that space, time, and perspective are all intertwined in an interpretation of the foremost.

            The internet is crazy. There's no other way to put it.
        </p>
        <p>
            A landscape of creation, expressions of every emotion known to humankind, all amplified on a scale empowering communication
            and the individual like never before. It mirrors our society, yet amplifies all of our collective features to a figurative eleven.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can do almost anything on the internet: chat with people, readily find information, purchase goods and services &#8212; for almost anything
            that exists in our physical realm there exists some digital analogue that functions similarly. To put it another way,
        </p>
        <span class="quote">"There's an app for that."</span>
        <p>
            If so much of our physical lives is digital now, then so is the space that would govern it.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example, imagine a chat service. The spaces of each chat of your chats with your friends mean distinct things to you. They all exist simultaneously,
            and within their spaces contain different memories, emotions, and relationships. But another chatroom between two friends may mean nothing to you if you do
            not know the people who it belongs to. Regardless, we can see that the same properties and examinations of space can be conducted on "digital spaces".
        </p>
        <p>
            But why stop there? What does the space that the entire website represents mean to us? What can the halls of our search engines reveal to us about themselves?
            There is so much we can see if we venture through the looking-glass.
        </p>

            I hope that this experience proved to be an interesting introspective on the spaces we inhabit and provoked thought on their digital analogues.
